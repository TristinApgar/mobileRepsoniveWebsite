                                <p>Peashooter is an assault class for the plants. He has 125 health, and he is able to shoot large peas which deal around 20 damge, at fairly medium fire rate. Peashooter has 3 abilities, chili bomb, gatling pea, and speed and jump boost. With chili bomb, peashooter can deploy a chili bomb that can explode, causing massive damage to nearby zombies, it's great for crowd control. Gatling pea has the peashooter stick himself in the ground, which causes him being unable to move, puts on a helmet, a gatling gun sticking out of his mouth hole thing, and begin unloading rapid fire peas onto zombies, causing incredibly damage to zombies in his sight, but due to him being unable to move, a foot soldier can fire a rocket at him, vanquishing him immediately, so be careful using it. Speed and jump boost is literally the best ability in the entire game. With speed and jump boost, peashooter is able to run incredibly fast and jump super high, making it great to dodge zombie attacks, getting to advantagous spots, and being able to rush zombies. These abilities and his fire power make him an incredible assault class to use.</p>

                                <p>Chomper is an mixture of assault and defense class for the plants. Chomper is by far the unique class in the whole game. For starters, chomper can only do melee or close ranged attacks, due to him being only able to chomp, or depending on what sub-class you use, spray his enemies. Chomper can chomp rather quickly, making for a fairly fast fire rate, and every chomp deals around 25 damage. Spraying is for certain sub-class chompers. When chomper attacks, he can hurl out fire, acid, green stuff, electircity, etc. Depending on the sub-class, spraying does mild damage to his enemies, mostly because his attacks rely on the effects the spray gives to the zombies. Chomper has either 150 health or 175 health. The biggest reason why chomper is so unique is because he is able to swallow a zombie, killing them instantly. Chomper is able to grab a zombie from behind, and eat them, this can encourage chomper to play stealthfully or ambush zombies. Chompers abilities are spike weed, burrow, or goop. Spike weed has chomper spit out a trap that has a face and weeds on it. Spike weed acts sort of like a bear trap. When a zombie steps on the spike weed, they are stuck and take damage for a short period of time. This can allow the chomper to secure a kill by easily swallowing them, and it can also help fellow plants secure a kill. Burrow is chomper's mobile abilty. Burrow has chompers dig underground, and move quickly, while under a short time period. Burrow also has the ability for chomper to eat zombies from underground, by jumping up under them and swallowing them, allowing for a safe kill when you play your cards right. Goop has chomper spit out goop. When goop collides with a zombie, they are incredibly slow, allowing chomper to secure an easy kill. It also can be used a projectile almost, since it does deal small amount of damge. These abilities and this chomping and eating power make chomper an incredibly deadly class, however chomper can barely defend himself from a large crowd of zombies, so it is best to target one zombie away from other zombies. </p>

                                <p>Sunflower is the healing class for plants. Sunflower has 100 health, and she is able to shoot sun bullet things at a fast pace. Since Sunflower is the main support class, she is able to revive plants much faster than the average class. However sunflower is not great at vanquishing zombies, infact she is the weakest character in the game, but she makes that up for being able to heal other plants incredibly well. Her main healing ability  is her heal beam, which when used near another plant, attatches a yellow beam to a plant, being able to heal them with ease. Her other healing ability has her deploy a little sunflower in a pot. The little sunflower shoots out sun, which nearby plants can pick up to heal themselves. The little sunflower pot allows the Sunflower to heal multiple plants at once. Her final ability is her laser beam. Sunflower sticks herself in the ground, making her unable to move. She then is able to shoot a laser beam which does heavy damage to zombies. Her laser beam is very similar to peashooters gatling ability. Also just like peashooter, you are very vulnerable when doing this, so you may get shot down by a foot soldier's rocket. Most of the time you should be healing your fellow plants so there is rarely a good time to use her laser beam, but if there is no plants around and you are the only one to protect yourself, its definitely a good time to use the laser beam. Sunflower's healing power makes her an incredible and useful healer, and although she is a weak fighter, being able to heal her fellow fighting plants makes her quite the backup. </p>

                                <p>Cactus is a defense class for the plants. She has 125 health, and she is able to shoot cactus needles at fairly fast pace, causing great damage when played right. Cactus is more about staying behind the frontlines rather than being on the frontlines. Cactus' job is snipe down zombies from afar. Fighting zombies up close while playing as Cactus does not end well for Cactus. Cactus' abilities include potato mine, garlic drone, wallnut. Potato mine is where Cactus is able to deploy a potato mine because duh. If a zombie steps on a potato mine, it kills them instantly. Potato mines are great for defense. Cactus can either put tomato mines on objectives, or protect Cactus from zombies trying to flank you. The garlic drone is able to be deployed by Cactus. When deploying the garlic drone, the player will be able to control cactus drone. The drone can then fly around and is able to shoot down zombies. The drone can also launch corn that lands into the ground, then explodes, great for crowd control. However, the cactus drone has 5 health, making it incredibly easy to take down, so its best to be cautious when shooting a zombie or flying around. Its also important to know is that Cactus is idle when you are controling garlic drone, meaning Cactus is vulnerable when using the garlic drone. If cactus takes damage while using the drone, the drone will be destroyed, and you take control over cactus again. So it is best when using the drone to put cactus in a secluded spot. The last ability is the wallnuts, it's just bad. Like I literally don't know the use for it. You can maybe use it as a barricade, but zombies can jump over it. It's basically useless. These abilities and cactus' sniping power makes cactus great for defense and long range.</p>

                                <p>Foot Soldier is an assault class for the zombies. He has 125 health, and he has a paintball gun that has a fast fire rate dealing around 10 damage per bullet. Foot Soldier is a frontliner, with how efficient he is able to deal damage, he is great for taking out plants while chargin towards them. Foot Soldier abilities include stink bomb, rocket jump, zpg. Foot Soldier is able to throw a stink bomb, when the stink bomb collides on a surface, it creates a large cloud of purple smoke, which if plants are inside of it, deals damage to them. The smoke is hard to see through, so it can be used as a form of cover for zombies. It also is great for area control, being able to scare plants out of position. Foot Soldier can rocket jump with the help of his rocket launcher on his back. With the push of a button, Foot Soldier can jump a great height, allowing to reach areas most classes can't reach. You can also use it to reach peashooters who are camping on top of buildings or tall structures. Its great for countering burrowed chompers rushing towards you. It is also good for being able to get to a high surface, and shoot from a far. Then there's the zpg. Foot soldier can shoot a rocket from his rocket launcher on his back. Upon firing, the rocket propels rather quickly. Even though it is an explosive, the zpg has terrible splash damage, so it's best to aim for direct hits. The zpg is great for taking out peashooters who are using the gatling, or sunflowers using the laser beam due to them being unable to move. These abilities and fire power makes Foot Soldier an incredible assault class. </p>

                                <p>Engineer is an assault and also a defense class for the zombies. He has 125 health, and can shoot concrete out of his concrete launcher, dealing around 20 damage, similar to how peashooter shoots. Engineer can have a small variety of different playstyles, depending on how you use his abilities and his fire power. Engineer's main form of attack encourages more of an offensive playstyle. With how damaging the concrete launcher can be, it can encourage engineer to secure a vanquish at an efficient pace. Before going on to his main 3 abilities, Engineer has two exclusive abilities to the Gamemode Gardens and Graveyards. In Gardens and Graveyards, Engineer is able to make a teleporter. An icon of a wrench is shown to engineer, that icon directs Engineer to the unbuilt teleporter spot. When engineer comes in contact with the un-built teleporter, he is able to repair it, and get it running. The teleporter allows zombies to get to the capture point faster. However the teleporter is able to be easily destroyed by plants, so it can also be Engineer's job to defend the teleporter. Another exclusive ability to Gardens and Graveyards is builging little defense bots. Around the teleporter area, there will be these little bot piles. Engineer can rebuild these little machines, and can even upgrade them. The robots act like sentries, being able to lock onto a plant and begin firing at them. Depending on what level they are, they have different fire speeds and different forms of fire power. Level 1 has the bots shoot little laser beams that do minimal damage, although at a fast pace. level 2 has the bots shoot tiny rockets that do average damage, at a fairly fast pace. level 3 bots have 2 rockets that they can fire which do a good amount of damage, at a fairly slow pace. The teleporters and the bots encourage a defensive playstyle for engineer. Engineer's abilties include speaker phone, jack hammer, and bot drone. Speaker phone has the engineer throw a speaker phone, when the speaker phone collides with a surface, it causes a boom of noise, which if plants get in contact with, can stun them for a short period of time, which can encourage offensive play and can help Engineer secure a vanquish. Engineer's jackhammer has the Engineer ride on top of an active jack hammer. When engineer is riding his jackhammer, he is able to move faster, and if he bumps into plants, he can knock them back, which can stun them until they hit the ground. Also the jackhammer can counter chomper, if chomper attempts to eat engineer while riding his jackhammer, chomper will instead eat the jackhammer, making Engineer unharmed. Lastly is the bot drone. The drone is similar to cactus' garlic drone. The bot drone can fly around, allowing for aerial support. The drone is great when engineer is staying back near the teleporter, allowing Engineer to go towards the frontlines without leaving defense. The drone fires laser beams at a fast pace. Basically the drone acts exactly like the cactus drone. The drone cna lancher cone bombs that land into the ground, causing splash damage. The drone has 5 health, so it's best to take down plants cautiously. Yada yada since you're controlling the drone, engineer is idle, making him vulnerable, and when engineer takes damage, your drone is destroyed, and you take control over engineer again. Engineer encourages different kinds of playstyles, whether it'd be defensive or offensive, Engineer is great for different types of situations. </p>

                                <p>Scientist is a support class for the zombies, but can also be a great assault class. Scientist has 100 health, and has a goo blaster that acts like a shotgun, which can do incredible damage up close. Since Scientist is the main healer, he is able to revive zombies faster than the average class. Unlike his healer counter-part Sunflower, Scientist is able to protect himself with ease, so sometimes playing Scientist does not encourage supporting teammates, but rather yourself. Of course though, Scientist does have less health than the average class, so he can work well with his fellow zombies. Scientist abilities include healing station, warp, and sticky bombs. The healing station is what makes the Scientist the main healer for the zombies. Upon using the healing station, Scientist deploys a tube that sprinkles out purple goo stuff that if a zombie is nearby, will heal them. The healing station is great for healing multiple zombies at once, however it can also be used to keep Scientist alive in difficult situation. for example, the scientist and maybe other zombie players are attacking a capture point, and they make it to the point. While on the point, plants begin firing and vanquishing zombies. To keep himself and other zombies alive, he can deploy a healing station on the capture point so that they can heal themselves while under fire. The healing station is great as a form of life support. The warp is where Scientist can teleport forward quickly. When the scientist uses the warp, he basically dashes forward, allowing for great mobility. The warp is also great for going behind an attacking plant and take them down from behind. It is also good to counter burrowed chompers by teleporting away at the right time. The sticky bomb is basically describing itself in the name. Its a bomb that can stick to any surface, and when a plant comes in proximity of the bomb, it detonates, causing 50 damage. The sticky bomb can be good for defense, as a way to catch plants off guard and have Scientist get a vanquish with a better chance. Scientist can also stick the bombs onto plants and zombies, so it can be another tool of damage while fighting a plant, or you can stick it to a zombie allowing for better protection for them. The Scientist can be a great support class, although there is less emphasis on healing your teammates. Scientist's abilities can make him an indestructible, killing machine.</p>

                                <p>All-Star can be a stupid dumb stupid sometimes, mostly depending on what sub-class you are using, but we are focusing on the default All-star. The default All-star is actually one of the best All-star variants, so forget what I said at the start of this description. All-star is a defense/tank class of the zombies. He has 200 health, and he has a football launching machine gun which is dope. When he fires his football launcher, it causes his too slow down, which makes All-star a more vulnerable target, which explains the large amount of health he has. Suprisingly though, All-star's weapon is actually weaker than Foot-soldier's paintball gun thingy. Well from my experience it feels like it's weaker. Both Foot Soldier's weapon and All-Star's weapon are very similar fire rates. It's a weird case but I honestly can't put my finger on it. Moving on, All-star is not the best at attacking, however he is good at protecting his fellow zombies and himself, well his abilities are the reason for that. If All-star doesn't have any abilities availible to him, he basically becomes defenseless, and his weapon doesn't do much to protect himself. All-star's abilities include imp punt, dummy, and tackle. Imp punt is where All-star deploys an imp holding a bomb, kicks it away, then the imp punt explodes causing incredible damage to plants who are close too the explosion. The explosion is not as great as peashooter's, but it makes up for that by detonating quickly. The imp punt is great when a plant catches you off guard and revving up your mini-gun won't cut it. It's quick and effecient to use, and can be devastating to plants who are bunched up together. The dummy has All-star deploy a football dummy that acts as a form of cover, which is infinitely better than the wall nut wall since it can actually cover an entire all-star's body, and plants cannot jump over it. It also can take a beating too, allowing all-star to peak out of cover and get some damage in while not worrying about your cover being destroyed. The tackle has the All-star rush forwards, dealing damage to plants in the way and knocking them back. It's better off you try and stun the plants with it rather than try to kill a plant with it. It's also good for countering burrowed chompers rushing towards you. If you have been paying any attention, All-star is suprisingly kinda weak in a sense. Without All-star's abilities, he relies on his gun which can slow him down and does not do enough damage to an enemy plant when you are in a dire situation. or maybe I just suck playing him, I don't know but he is by far my least favorite class in the game. Battle For Neighborville's version of all star is superior in every way.</p>

                                    <p>Boss mode is fairly complicated to explain but I'll try and break it down. Boss mode plays nothing like the other characters. When you pick bossmode, you are brought to a screen that displays the overview of the map you are playing on. Only one person can play as boss mode. if a player is bossmode, other characters will be able to see Crazy Dave's rv if someone on plants picks bossmode, or zomboss' airship if someone on zombies picks it. Both of these flying vehicles are able to be shot down, however they have 2500 health, so it will take some dedication to bringin them down. Back to the map, you are shown where your teammates are on the map, your job is to support them as best as you can. You have 4 different ways of supporting you teammates, but in order to do that, you need to collect either brains or sun, depending what team you are on. Brains or sun will either be given to you if your teammates get a vanquish, or brains and sun randomly fall from the top of the screen. The first ability is a satelite, which when deployed using your cursor, allows you too see the battlefield from your teammates perspective. This can be good to see where the enemy is or strategize your way into how you can help your team. The next ability is the healing station. Whether it's a double headed sunflower pot, or a cool looking zombie healing station. The healing station allows you to heal your teammates greatly. Cherry bomb has you deploy </p>
