                <p>Hello, and welcome to the Why Garden Warfare is good website. You may have clicked on this page to find out if Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare is good. Short answer is yes. This website will tell you why.</p>
                <p>Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare is of course based on the original Plants vs Zombies, developed by popcap. Garden Warfare is a team based third-person class shooter, with 10 different playable classes, each of them being very unique from one-another. <a href="classes.html">Click here to go to the classes page.</a></p>
                <p>There are 2 teams in Garden Warfare, the Plants, and the Zombies. Both teams offer very distinct classes from one another, with each class being able to counter other classes from the opposing team. Each class has special abilities that they can perform, whether it'd be used for traversal, healing, or to vanquish the enemy player.</p>
                <p>A very big part of Garden Warfare is the currency system. In Garden Warfare, after you've played a round, you earn coins. These coins can be used for stickerpacks, which can unlock a variety of things like cosmetics, pots and browncoat zombies, and sub-classes.</p>
                <p>Speaking of sub-classes, sub-classes are a major part of Garden Warfare. Sub-classes add a much larger variety of gameplay and adds more depth to the main classes. Instead of having only 4 different classes on each team, sub-classes can add over 100 different classes. Each sub-class also offers a unique look, so its easy to define what sub-class someone is playing as.</p>
                <p>There are 9 different <a href="gamemodes.html">gamemodes</a>  to play on, Team Vanquish, Team Vanquish Classic, Gardens & Graveyards, Gardens & Graveyards Classic, Suburbination, Gnome Bomb, Taco Bandits, Vanquish Confirmed, and Garden Ops. Unlike many other multiplayer games, many gamemodes share maps with different gamemodes, except for Gardens & Graveyards, that gamemode has its own map selection. </p>
